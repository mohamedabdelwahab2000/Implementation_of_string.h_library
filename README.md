## memchr function
The C library function void *memchr(const void *str, int c, size_t n) searches for the first occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the first n bytes of the string pointed to, by the argument str.
## memmove function
The C library function void *memmove(void *str1, const void *str2, size_t n) copies n characters from str2 to str1, but for overlapping memory blocks, memmove() is a safer approach than memcpy().
## strcat function
C strcat() function appends the string pointed to by src to the end of the string pointed to by dest. It will append a copy of the source string in the destination string.
